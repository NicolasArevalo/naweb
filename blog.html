                <h1>Arcoiris</h1><br>
                <h5 id="fecha">by Nicolás Arévalo, 2021.</h5>
                <p>It's interesting look at the rainbows, ain't? I was thinking about that the last time I saw one. Think about that the rainbow just appear 
                    when the sun and the rain be together, how goodness the sun and the rain. There're so many stories around the rainbow. Someones look at the rainbow
                    as a religion sign, some others as a normal thing. But the way that I see it are different. I think the earth wants to thank to rain and the sun 
                    for their job, knowing how fundamental are them. I think its the way for the earth to show that they are making good. Let's do the good, too. Maybe someone, someday give us a rainbow.

                <p>This story is in private mode 'cause it's in a competition. You'll be able to read it soon. For now I
                    can tell you that is amazing.</p>

                <h1>5mentarios podcast</h1><br>
                <h5 id="fecha">by Nicolás Arévalo, 2021.</h5>
                <p>This is my podcast. It's in spanish (for now ;). In a try to read more, I decide to create a podcast
                    reading books (taking it as a job make me more committed).
                    At this day, it doesn't have listeners, actually, I think the one of two reps are mine when I test
                    it haha. But that made a compromise in me. Now I'm periodically reading. The initial mind was to
                    read
                    only Colombian books, to highlight the Colombian writers (and let me know them in their books for my
                    own culture); but
                    I think that eventually I'mma read other books, there is some much books I want to read, so I will
                    make a change in the style of the brand, but shhh, nobody knows. </p>

                <h1>La palma</h1>
                <br>
                <h5 id="fecha">by Nicolás Arévalo, 2021.</h5>
                <p>This picture was taken in Neiva, do you know where is Neiva? I found out it in my geography class.
                    But it's more than something in the map.
                </p>
                <p> There is a lot in this planet, you know? Each place cold or hot, rich or poor, got its own magic.
                    We always say the same: <em>we are tiny in this universe</em> , but that phrase is just inertia. We
                    just repeat it. Please, take a moment to think how many lifes
                    there's around you. What about in your country? Think of the universe. Could there be aliens? If we
                    are
                    that tiny, why not? so insignificant, but with a whole universe inside us.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="note img2">
                <h1>Moon</h1><br>
                <h5 id="fecha">by Nicolás Arévalo, 2021.</h5>
                <p>As you can see, I like the photography. I want to buy a professional camera and take better pics. But
                    well, I've always been a moon fan. As I typed in Palma's note, I think we're so insignificant in
                    this
                    universe, and a proof of it is the moon, look at it, what you can see? from here it's just a
                    ball no more than 1 or 2 cm. Dimension that. Its radio is of 1.737,4 km. And we just see a couple
                    cm. </p>
                <p>Always brightning. A few days more than others, but there is she, showing us how tiny we're.</p>

                <h1>Iglesia</h1><br>
                <h5 id="fecha">by Nicolás Arévalo, 2021.</h5>
                <p>Where I live is a town, and as a normal town in Colombia, it has a central park. Usually, it has the
                    bus station there, or close.
                    And the most turistic place in the towns around Colombia is the church, as you can see in the
                    picture. Why that matter? Actually I think it doesn't matter at all. But well, you're here reading
                    me, tell me you: why that matter? </p>
